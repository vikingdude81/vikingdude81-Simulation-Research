3. **Risk-adjusted returns better** - return per unit of risk
4. **Survivability** - protects in corrections/crashes

### Why S/R Helps (Phase D)

1. **Better entry timing** - proximity bonuses
2. **Reduced drawdown** - -1.07% vs -1.71% (37% improvement!)
3. **Quality filtering** - only take high-probability setups

## 🎯 Risk-Adjusted Performance

### Return/Drawdown Ratio (Sharpe-like)

```
Phase A: 7.55% / 1.71% = 4.42
Phase C: 5.09% / 1.33% = 3.83
Phase D: 5.42% / 1.07% = 5.07 ⭐ WINNER
```

**Phase D has 15% better risk-adjusted returns than Phase A**  
**Phase D has 32% better risk-adjusted returns than Phase C**

### What This Means

For every 1% of risk (drawdown), you get:
- **Phase A**: 4.42% return
- **Phase C**: 3.83% return
- **Phase D**: 5.07% return ⭐

**Phase D is the most efficient risk/reward system!**
