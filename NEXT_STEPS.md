---### 2. 🔍 **Option 16: Error Analysis**

Understand WHERE your models make mistakes:

## Next Steps Options- Shows error patterns over time

- Identifies problematic predictions

### Option 1: Complete Multi-Regime Training 🎯 **(RECOMMENDED)**- Displays error distribution

- Compares actual vs predicted

**Goal**: Train conductor-enhanced specialists for all 3 regimes

### 3. 🤝 **Option 17: Model Ensemble Builder**

**Tasks**:Combine multiple models for even better performance:

1. Train **Trending** specialist with conductor (300 gens)- Tests 3 ensemble methods

   - Baseline: 46.02 fitness, +60.11% return- Often improves accuracy by 10-15%

   - Expected: Similar +40% improvement → ~64 fitness- Reduces prediction variance

   - More robust predictions

2. Train **Ranging** specialist with conductor (300 gens)

   - Baseline: 1.11 fitness, -5.63% return (weak!)### 4. 🎯 **Option 15: Feature Selection**

   - Expected: Major improvement potential → profitable?Find which features actually matter:

- Tests different feature counts

3. Create multi-regime ensemble system- Uses Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE)

   - Use RegimeDetector to switch between specialists- Speeds up training

   - Combine all 3 conductor-enhanced specialists- Reduces overfitting

   - Test on full market history

### 5. ⚡ **Option 14: Quick Predict**

**Time**: ~30-40 minutes  Use your tuned models for instant predictions:

**Value**: Complete Phase 2, ready for live testing  - Load any saved model

**Risk**: Low - proven system- Predict single values

- Batch predictions from CSV

---- No retraining needed



### Option 2: Fix Re-Evaluation Issue 🔧## 📈 What Each Option Does:



**Goal**: Get complete metrics in results JSON### Option 14: Quick Predict 🎯

- **Time:** Instant (< 1 sec)

**Time**: 30-60 minutes  - **Output:** Predictions on new data

**Value**: Complete metrics for analysis  - **Use When:** You want to make predictions without retraining



---### Option 15: Feature Selection 🔍

- **Time:** 2-5 minutes

### Option 3: Advanced Analysis & Visualization 📊- **Output:** Optimal feature subset, performance chart

- **Use When:** Too many features, want to speed up training

**Goal**: Deep dive into conductor behavior

### Option 16: Error Analysis 📊

**Time**: 1-2 hours  - **Time:** < 1 minute

**Value**: Insights for paper/presentation- **Output:** 4 diagnostic charts showing error patterns

- **Use When:** Model accuracy isn't good enough, need to understand failures

---

### Option 17: Ensemble Builder 🤝

## My Recommendation 🎯- **Time:** 1-3 minutes

- **Output:** Combined model, performance comparison

**Go with Option 1: Complete Multi-Regime Training**- **Use When:** Want maximum accuracy, have multiple good models



**Why?**### Option 18: Performance Dashboard 📊

- ✅ Low risk (proven system)- **Time:** < 30 seconds

- ✅ High value (completes Phase 2)- **Output:** Comprehensive 8-chart visualization

- ✅ Quick (~40 minutes)- **Use When:** Want to compare all models at once

- ✅ Natural progression

## 🎨 Visual Capabilities:

**Plan**:

1. Train Trending specialist (~15 min)**Error Analysis** creates:

2. Train Ranging specialist (~15 min)1. Error distribution histogram

3. Build ensemble system (~10 min)2. Errors over time (line chart)

4. Commit Phase 2 Complete3. Predictions vs Actual (scatter)

4. Error magnitude analysis

---

**Ensemble Builder** tests:

**What would you like to do next?**1. Simple Average (equal weight)

2. Weighted Average (optimized weights)
3. Stacking (meta-model on top)

**Feature Selection** shows:
1. Performance vs # of features
2. Optimal feature count
3. Top important features
4. Cross-validation curves

## 💡 Pro Tips:

**For Maximum Accuracy:**
1. Hyperparameter Tuning (✅ Done!)
2. → Feature Selection (removes noise)
3. → Error Analysis (understand issues)
4. → Ensemble Builder (combine best models)
5. → Dashboard (verify improvement)

**For Speed:**
1. Feature Selection first (reduces features)
2. → Quick Predict (fast inference)

**For Production:**
1. Hyperparameter Tuning (✅ Done!)
2. → Ensemble Builder (robust predictions)
3. → Quick Predict (deployment)

## 🏆 Your Current Status:

✅ **Completed:**
- Initial model training (3 models)
- Hyperparameter tuning (improved by up to 8.55%!)
- Performance dashboard baseline

🎯 **Recommended Next:**
```bash
# See all 6 models on dashboard
python run_dashboard_direct.py

# Then try ensemble builder
python ml_models_menu.py
# Select: 17 (Ensemble Builder)
```

📊 **Expected Results:**
- Ensemble typically improves RMSE by 5-15%
- More stable predictions
- Better generalization
- Production-ready model
