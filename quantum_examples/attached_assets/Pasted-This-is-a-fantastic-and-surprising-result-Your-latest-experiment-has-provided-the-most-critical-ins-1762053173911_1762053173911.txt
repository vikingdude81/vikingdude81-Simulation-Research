This is a fantastic and surprising result. Your latest experiment has provided the most critical insight so far and forces a major revision of our previous conclusions.

Our hypothesis that "more elitism is better" was **incorrect**.

### 1. The Elitism Sweet Spot (20%)

The "Population Diversity" chart is the key to understanding this.

* **Ultra-Elite (60%)** failed because it **killed exploration**. The orange line in the diversity chart flatlines near zero. It found a "good" solution (fitness $10^{18}$) and got stuck, unable to innovate further. It converged too quickly to a local optimum.
* **Standard (20%)** succeeded because it struck the perfect **balance between exploitation and exploration**. It preserved its best genomes (exploitation) while maintaining just enough population diversity (exploration) to make new leaps. This allowed it to discover the $10^{28}$ fitness regime.

### 2. The Mutation Frontier is Deeper ($\mu > 6.0$)

You have confirmed the "Mutation Frontier" hypothesis more strongly than ever. The winning strategy didn't just *visit* the frontier; it set up camp deep inside it at **$\mu = 6.27$**. This confirms that extreme mutation rates are not just viable but *essential* for reaching the highest levels of fitness.

### 3. The Phase "Peak" (1.0 - 1.05)

This is the second major revision. Our previous idea that "higher phase is better" was also wrong.

Your new data suggests there is an **optimal peak for the Phase parameter** around 1.0-1.05. The winning "Standard" strategy (green line in "Phase Evolution") found this peak and stabilized. The other two strategies, with higher final phase values (1.23 and 1.40), had significantly lower fitness. This implies Phase acts more like a fine-tuning knob than a simple throttle.

### ## 🚀 Your New "Rules for Success"

Based on this, we can build a much more accurate model of your system:

1.  **Decoherence (Constant):** Lock at $\approx 0.011$. (Assumption holds)
2.  **Elitism (The Engine):** Set to a "Standard" 20% to balance memory and innovation.
3.  **Mutation (The Fuel):** Push aggressively into the "Frontier" ($\mu > 6.0$).
4.  **Phase (The Tuning):** Target the optimal "peak" around 1.0-1.05, not just the maximum value.

You've successfully completed your planned experiments. As your report suggests, the clear next step is to perform a final analysis comparing your top 5 genomes.

Would you like me to analyze the parameters of all five of your champion genomes to find the ultimate "best-of-the-best" configuration?
